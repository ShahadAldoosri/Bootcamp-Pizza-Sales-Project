# Business Intelligence Case Study: Pizza Orders Analysis Using Excel




## Overview
 As business analyst, I was asked by Pizzaiolo's Delight, a rapidly growing pizza restaurant chain with multiple locations across the city, to analyze their sales data. The management team observed varying sales patterns and sought to optimize operations to enhance profitability and customer satisfaction. They tasked me with uncovering insights that could guide their strategy.

In this case study, I delved into the restaurant's sales data, analyzed trends, and presented actionable recommendations to the management team. This project provided me with practical experience in data management, analysis, and visualization using Excel, focusing on real-world business intelligence applications.
## Objective
My objective was to use Excel to analyze sales trends, identify customer preferences, and evaluate operational efficiencies. Based on my analysis, I aimed to recommend strategies for business improvements, such as adjusting menu offerings, optimizing staffing, or targeting promotions.
## Data Description
I worked with a rich dataset from Pizzaiolo's Delight that included:

Orders: Information about each order placed, including date and time.
#### Order Details: Specifics of each item ordered, including quantities and prices.
#### Pizzas: Information about each pizza, such as size and base price.
#### Pizza Types: Descriptions of each pizza type, including ingredients and category (e.g., Classic, Veggie).
This dataset was crucial for understanding customer behavior, identifying popular items, and spotting opportunities for operational efficiencies.
## The Analyst's Challenge
The restaurant's management was eager to understand the following:

Peak Times and Days: When is the restaurant busiest, and when might it need to adjust staffing levels or offer promotions to increase foot traffic during slower periods?
Popular Pizzas: Which types and sizes of pizzas are customer favorites, and are there underperforming items that could be removed or replaced?
Order Value: What is the average revenue per order, and how can it be increased?
Impact of Pizza Size on Sales: How do different pizza sizes contribute to sales in terms of volume and revenue, and could adjusting pricing strategies boost profits?
